# flat-gui
Library of GUI elements for Qt C++ applications

The FlatGUI library allows Qt5 users to build elegant 
graphical user interfaces for desktop applications in C++ 
without the need of using technologies other than widgets. 
The GUI elements are tested fully under Windows 7/10 and 
partially under Ubuntu 17 Desktop. The library is open 
source and you are welcome to use it and contribute to it.

Enjoy!
