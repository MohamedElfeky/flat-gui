	\title Flat GUI
	\brief Contains classes for writing mobile-app-like
	graphical user interfaces for desktop applications.

	The network module provides classes to make network
	programming easier and portable. It offers both
	high-level classes such as QNetworkAccessManager that
	implements application-level protocols, and
	lower-level classes such as QTcpSocket, QTcpServer, and
	QUdpSocket.
